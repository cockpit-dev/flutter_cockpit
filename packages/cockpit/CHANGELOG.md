# Changelog

## 1.1.2

- Fixed development supervisor startup so the background Dart process uses the `cockpit` tool package resolution context instead of the launched Flutter app workspace.

## 1.1.1

- Fixed the public `package:cockpit/cockpit.dart` export surface so launch configuration CLI/MCP helpers and their `args` types are available to downstream packages.

## 1.1.0

- Added shared Flutter launch configuration support across CLI, MCP, YAML workflows, development sessions, remote sessions, target launch, and platform launchers, including repeatable dart defines, dart define files, process environment values, and safe extra Flutter arguments.
- Added non-blocking AI development launch flows where `launch-app` returns after readiness while a background supervisor keeps logs, reload, restart, stop, screenshot, and recording control available.
- Added production workflow execution with YAML/JSON scripts, conditions, branching, loops, retry, step descriptions, traceable step artifacts, issue evidence, and bundle-ready output roots.
- Added Devtools live observability with scoped sessions, dense timeline ordering, collapsible panels, media previews, bundle download, workflow submission, and per-run artifact linking.
- Added system-first screenshot and recording orchestration with app-level fallback when allowed, plus representative recording previews and keyframe storyboards.
- Expanded Native/System Control Plane capability discovery and platform adapters for Android, iOS simulator/device, macOS, Windows, Linux, and web, with truthful availability metadata and explicit blocked-by-environment diagnostics.
- Improved CLI output rendering with AI-readable defaults, JSON output for pipelines, file output modes, and path-only terminal responses for file writes.
- Hardened host process, recorder, web bridge, simulator, and artifact download behavior so long-running development loops remain bounded and recoverable.

## 1.0.0

- Initial public release of the host-side tooling layer for `flutter_cockpit`
- Added CLI and MCP entrypoints for session bootstrap, control execution, snapshot collection, orchestration, and validation
- Added the Native/System Control Plane: `read-system-capabilities` and `run-system-action` (CLI and MCP) with capability-truthful Android adb, iOS simctl+WebDriverAgent, desktop, and web profiles, declared parameter contracts, and payload validation
- Added scene-level system macros for real debugging blockers: `resolveBlockers`, `preparePermissions`, `recoverToApp`, `tapNotification`, `readFocusState`, and `stabilizeForScreenshot`
- Added Android SystemUI demo-mode status bar overrides (`setStatusBar`/`clearStatusBar`) for deterministic screenshot evidence
- Added desktop host-plane actions through built-in tooling: system settings entry, host appearance, host file push/pull and media copy, app recovery, focus and device reads, notifications, and macOS `tccutil` permission resets
- Added web (browser) evidence through host window adapters so screenshots and recordings work once the browser app id or process id is known
- Added native system log reads (`readSystemLogs`: logcat, unified log, journalctl, Windows event log) so startup crashes are diagnosable before the runtime observer attaches
- Added Android battery simulation (`setBattery`) and connectivity toggles (`setConnectivity`), plus iOS simulator locale switching (`setLocale`)
- Added task-run bundle writing, summary shaping, structured `logs.json` evidence, and delivery evidence handling
- Added `read-task-bundle-summary` CLI output for low-token bundle review alongside MCP `read_task_bundle_summary`
- Added AI-readable default stdout rendering with JSON/path/file output formats for shell-friendly workflows
- Added sortable task-run bundle names, screenshot names, and recording keyframe paths for chronological artifact review
- Added host-side screenshot and recording adapters with validation and keyframe extraction
- Added remote session launchers for Android emulators, iOS simulators and devices, macOS, Windows, and Linux, with best-effort app cleanup when launch readiness fails
- Added collapsible Devtools dashboard panels with persisted panel layout and global collapse/expand controls for dense timeline, evidence, launcher, and inspector reviews
- Added live Devtools run scoping, timeline ordering controls, media preview, run bundle download, and workflow submission support for long-running validation sessions
- Fixed screenshot-only task bundle summaries so stale recording failure fields no longer block delivery gates when video was not requested
- Fixed development `launch-app` so it returns after readiness while the background supervisor keeps logs, reload, restart, and stop control alive
- Fixed `run-shell` and host recorder helper commands so short CLI/MCP calls are bounded, killable, and do not inherit recording startup timeouts
- Fixed stale development `stop-app` cleanup so platform app processes are stopped even when the supervisor is already unreachable
- Fixed the real MCP surface verifier so `serve-mcp` shutdown cleanup is bounded and cannot hang the validation run
- Fixed web bridge hot reload routing so stale browser reconnects cannot replace a ready client or hijack response ids
- Fixed transient artifact download timeouts by retrying retryable remote unavailability without masking structured artifact errors
- Fixed transient iOS simulator `simctl` clipboard/status/read failures with limited safe-action retries while preserving final failure diagnostics
