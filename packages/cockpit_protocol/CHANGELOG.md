# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- Added project, suite, fixture, matrix, campaign policy, aggregate report, and
  report-case contracts to `cockpit.test/v2`.
- Added native/test-id/role/coordinate locator strategies and a system action
  contract for black-box setup, device control, and cleanup steps.
- Renamed the pure-Dart package from `flutter_cockpit_protocol` to
  `cockpit_protocol` as the sole owner of platform-neutral Cockpit models.
- Renamed the public libraries to `cockpit_protocol.dart` and
  `cockpit_remote_bridge_protocol.dart` without a compatibility forwarding
  package.
- Added the strict `cockpit.test/v2` case, action, locator, variable, policy,
  run/result/error, import, and `cockpit.report/v2` bundle contracts with a
  published JSON Schema 2020-12 document.
- Published a generated, byte-identical Dart representation of the test schema
  so compiled host tools validate against the same contract as non-Dart clients.
- Added the strict `cockpit.foundation/v2` DTOs, JSON Schema 2020-12 document,
  and OpenAPI 3.1 contract for Supervisor discovery, roots, workspaces, typed
  operations, standalone runs, durable events, artifacts, leases, paging,
  idempotency, version/feature negotiation, and structured recovery.
- Published byte-identical embedded foundation schema and OpenAPI constants for
  compiled CLI, MCP, GUI, and third-party Dart clients.

## 1.1.4

- Synced the published protocol contract fallback documents with the repository contracts so global tooling and MCP resources expose the same AI development and bundle traceability protocol as monorepo checkouts.

## 1.1.3

- Initial pure Dart protocol package extracted from `flutter_cockpit` so `cockpit` can run as a hosted global Dart executable.
